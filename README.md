# Smarthome---Expensive-Modern-Security-Risk-
Smarthome applications are usually very expensive and there are few ways to get around the price. In addition, the data is usually stored on servers in the USA and is almost defenseless against hackers in case of doubt. HomeKit from Apple would be a somewhat safer alternative, but it is very expensive!   This is something we want to improve.   We built a smarthome model that not only has smart features, but is also built smart. We built in two floors to make the wiring as unobtrusive as possible. There is also a Raspberry Pi as a server, which communicates with several Esp32. The communication is done via Mosquitto. In addition, an interface is provided for the users via NodeRed. This can be used to control the smart home.  Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)
